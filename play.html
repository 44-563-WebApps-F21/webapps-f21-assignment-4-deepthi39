        <p style="white-space: pre">
            <h6>MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6>  <p>Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret?</p>

            <h6>LADY BASILDON</h6>  <p>I suppose so.  Are you?</p>
            
            <h6>MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6>  <p>Yes.  Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?</p>
            
            <h6>LADY BASILDON.</h6>  <p>Horribly tedious!  Never know why I go.  Never know why I
                go anywhere.</p>
            
            <h6>MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6>  <p>I come here to be educated.</p>
            
            <h6>LADY BASILDON.</h6>  <p>Ah! I hate being educated!</p>
            
            <h6>MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6>  <p>So do I.  It puts one almost on a level with the
                commercial classes, doesn’t it?  But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always
                telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life.  So I come
                here to try to find one.</p>
            
           <h6>LADY BASILDON.</h6>  <p>[_Looking round through her lorgnette_.]  I don’t see
            anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose.
            The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole
            time.</p>
            
            <h6>MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6> <p>How very trivial of him!</p>
            
            <h6>LADY BASILDON.</h6>  <p>Terribly trivial!  What did your man talk about?</p>
            
            <h6>MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6>  <p>About myself.</p>
            
            <h6>LADY BASILDON.</h6> <p>[_Languidly_.]  And were you interested?</p>
            
            <h6>MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6>  <p>[_Shaking her head_.]  Not in the smallest degree.</p>
            
            <h6>LADY BASILDON.</h6>  <p>What martyrs we are, dear Margaret!</p>
            
            <h6>MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6> <p>[_Rising_.]  And how well it becomes us, Olivia!</p>
            
            <p>[_They rise and go towards the music-room_.  _The_ VICOMTE DE NANJAC, _a
            young attaché known for his neckties and his Anglomania_, _approaches
            with a low bow_, _and enters into conversation_.]</p>
            
            <h6>MASON.</h6>  <p>[_Announcing guests from the top of the staircase_.]  Mr. and
                Lady Jane Barford.  Lord Caversham.</p>
            
            <p>[_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM, _an old gentleman of seventy_, _wearing the
            riband and star of the Garter_.  _A fine Whig type_.  _Rather like a
            portrait by Lawrence_.]</p>
            
            <h6>LORD CAVERSHAM.</h6> <p>Good evening, Lady Chiltern!  Has my good-for-nothing
                young son been here?</p>
            
            <h6>LADY CHILTERN.</h6>  <p>[_Smiling_.]  I don’t think Lord Goring has arrived yet.</p>
            
            <h6>MABEL CHILTERN.</h6>  <p>[_Coming up to_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]  Why do you call Lord
                Goring good-for-nothing?</p>
            
            <p>[MABEL CHILTERN _is a perfect example of the English type of prettiness_,
            _the apple-blossom type_.  _She has all the fragrance and freedom of a
            flower_.  _There is ripple after ripple of sunlight in her hair_, _and
            the little mouth_, _with its parted lips_, _is expectant_, _like the
            mouth of a child_.  _She has the fascinating tyranny of youth_, _and the
            astonishing courage of innocence_.  _To sane people she is not
            reminiscent of any work of art_.  _But she is really like a Tanagra
            statuette_, _and would be rather annoyed if she were told so_.]</p>
            
            <h6>LORD CAVERSHAM.</h6>  <p>Because he leads such an idle life.</p>
